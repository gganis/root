## Concluding Remarks ##

This is the end of our guided tour for beginners through PROOF. There is
still a lot coming to mind to be said, but by now you are experienced
enough to use the ROOT documentation, most importantly the
**[PROOF pages](http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/proof)**, but also
the **[ROOT home page](http://root.cern.ch)** and the **[ROOT reference
guide](http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/reference-guide)** with the
documentation of all ROOT classes.

A very useful way for you to continue exploring PROOF is to study the
examples in the sub-directory `tutorials/proof` of any ROOT installation.

**End of this guide ... but hopefully not of your interaction with PROOF !**
